The Greek myth that appeals to me is the myth of Heracles. I feel a kinship to this myth because some of his labors can be interpreted as metaphors for growing up. I also relate to him because he did not have a close relationship with his father. His feats of strength are also appealing in a fantastic comic book way comparable to those of the Incredible Hulk and the images of him battling giants and beasts still captures my imagination.
